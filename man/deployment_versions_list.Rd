\value{
Response from the API
 A list of details of the versions
  - `id`: Unique identifier for the deployment version (UUID)
  - `deployment`: Deployment name to which the version is associated
  - `version`: Version name
  - `default`: A boolean indicating whether the version is the default version
  - `description`: Description of the version
  - `environment`: Environment of the version
  - `environment_display_name`: Human readable name of the environment
  - `status`: The status of the version
  - `active_revision`: UUID of the active revision of the version. If no deployment files have been uploaded yet, it is None.
  - `latest_revision`: UUID of the latest revision of the version. If no deployment files have been uploaded yet, it is None.
  - `instance_type`: The reserved instance type for the version
  - `maximum_instances`: Upper bound of number of versions running
  - `minimum_instances`: Lower bound of number of versions running
  - `maximum_idle_time`: Maximum time in seconds a version stays idle before it is stopped
  - `labels`: Dictionary containing key/value pairs where key indicates the label and value is the corresponding value of that label
  - `creation_date`: The date when the version was created
  - `last_updated`: The date when the version was last updated
  - `monitoring`: Name of a notification group which contains contacts to send notifications when requests for the version fail and recover
  - `default_notification_group`: Name of a notification group which contains contacts to send notifications when requests for the version are completed
  - `request_retention_time`: Number of seconds to store requests to the version
  - `request_retention_mode`: Mode of request retention for requests to the version. It can be one of the following:
      - *none* - the requests will not be stored
      - *metadata* - only the metadata of the requests will be stored
      - *full* - both the metadata and input/output of the requests will be stored
  - `maximum_queue_size_express`: Maximum number of queued express requests for all instances of this deployment version
  - `maximum_queue_size_batch`: Maximum number of queued batch requests for all instances of this deployment version
  - `static_ip`: A boolean indicating whether the deployment version should get a static IP
  - `restart_request_interruption`: A boolean indicating whether the requests should be restarted in case of an interruption
  - `ports`: A list of ports to open up in the deployment
